# Browser
Today, we use browsers for application delivery. Instead of creating different apps for our applications, browsers are the medium through which we are able to reach all of our customers.

It is the medium for marketting our product, interface for our users, conifiguration and administration. But it was not designed for that purpose. By better understanding this architecture, we can deliver 
better products
secured environment, and
accessible content

History
  Before Mosaic (1993), there were browsers with no graphical interfaces. Mosaic became popular and it started popularizing internet. Then it was Netscape Navigator was the one and only dominator during 1994. Microsoft started the browser war by 1995 by providing it as a part of Windows. And captured entire market. How can Netscape miss the market. It was renamed as Mozilla Foundation and targetted web developers with its FireFox browser. Safari never had a big market but with its popular mobile device, it capture good part of market now. Opera never more than 2% of market.
  And then it is Chrome. Google as usual with its simplest interface and different approach to handle browser tab process separately proves its dominance.

  What is the business model behind these browsers? Why they need to fight for market share when they don't earn directly. But with their search engine they earn data. We know the value of data. Yahoo paid mozilla for this data and help advertisers to target users. So you get something free to involve you spending more. :)
  
Understand Client Server architecture
  Client whoever connects to internet need a browser (the client). It is going to talk to server and fetch what do you need. It is the simplest one side. But we need lot more application in between these communication.
